## 💡 **Useful Tips & Best Practices**
*Concise tips and lessons learned from various creators over the past year.*

*   **Modular Systems are Key**: Structure your VR project with independent systems (e.g., separate Input, Locomotion, UI, Audio managers) that communicate via events. This makes debugging and adding features much easier.
*   **Profile Early, Profile Often**: Use Unity's Profiler, specifically the **XR module**, from the start. Consistent performance (90/120 FPS) is non-negotiable for comfort.
*   **Leverage the XR Interaction Toolkit**: It's the industry standard for a reason. Deeply learn its components (`XR Rig`, `Interactors`, `Interactables`) before building custom solutions.
*   **Design for All Input Methods**: Consider how your interactions work with both **motion controllers** and **hand tracking**. Provide visual/haptic feedback for all actions.
*   **Test in the Headset Constantly**: What works on the desktop often feels different in VR. Regular headset testing is crucial for nailing scale, comfort, and usability.
